# Datacratic (Demo)

Datacratic is a concept demonstration of a **collective personal data governance system**.

Rather than treating personal data as an individual asset or a platform-owned resource,
Datacratic models data as a **democratically governed collective good**.

## What This Demo Shows
- Individual participation in a data collective
- Explicit consent for data pooling
- Collective approval thresholds enforced in code
- Transparent, inspectable governance logic

## Why a Browser-Only Demo
This project intentionally runs entirely in the browser using client-side logic.
This allows evaluators to inspect governance assumptions directly without
infrastructure or backend complexity.

## What This Is Not
- Not a production system
- Not a data marketplace
- Not blockchain-based

## Core Question
What if data power was exercised collectively rather than extracted individually?
